# MyNotes
Fully functional Android note keeping Application. Has login and signin authentication with email validation.

--------------------------------------------
Table of Contents:
Java, Android Studio, SQLite Database, Login, Signup, Password Reset, Note Creation, Updating, Reading and Deleting (CRUD operations)

--------------------------------------------
Installation:
Install Java & Android Studio from official website

------------------------------------------
Usage:
Clone this repository
Download and configure SQLite database [ I did, but Android automatically comes with it like an integrated feature]
If you want to see what's happening with database, you can download DB Browser for SQLite because SQLite comes with zero configuration and seeing data is difficult.
And Run

---------------------------------------
Issue:
Currently email is not sending for the password reset purpose. You can inspect the code in logcat and use that for testing purpose.
Highly appreciate if someone fixes the email sending problem

-------------------------------------
Further :
Can make it to support image, pdf or other file documents.

------------------------------------
Disclaimer : 
Publishing this app to the playstore is strictly prohibitted and will be reported if found so. This project is available only for the learning purpose.
